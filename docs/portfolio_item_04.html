                                It’s not about what you say; it’s about how you say it. James Baldwin once defined language as, “the key to identity and social acceptance.” He claims that one’s language determines what one’s outlook will be. Language can be the deciding factor in an important meeting or sales pitch. Knowing when and how to speak can be trivial. Coming prepared, however, isn’t the only thing one must know how to do. One must also know how to identify certain situations in which to act a certain way. People most often speak using colloquial language in their daily routine and don’t really develop their formal language skills. It is important that we delve deeper into this topic because modern colloquial language consists of many irregularities and inconsistencies when compared to formal language. Language is such an important skill to master as it can determine one’s identity and therefore it can impact how one will be accepted into society. However, it doesn’t always have to be formal, but rather it should be somewhere in between formal and informal.

                                Language is important because it can determine one’s future. Imagine someone always uses colloquial language. This is alright as this is how people normally talk in their day-to-day lives; however, now imagine that he is at a job interview and uses that same informal colloquial language. At this point, one must fathom the issues of this act. The job interviewer will reconsider his decision of even letting in this person to the job interview. This person most likely seems like he either doesn’t know anything about interviewing, has never taken a job interview, or simply is not serious about the job. The job interviewer will quickly usher him away and look for a replacement. Obviously, this is not the situation that anyone wants to be in. That’s why it’s always important to come prepared and ready to speak accordingly. There is a time and place for everything, including language. The improper use of language can result in unwanted consequences.

                                The use of informal language in a setting such as a job interview or interview with an important individual has the possibility of resulting in one to either be disregarded or regarded with a lower status. Imagine one goes to talk to the president of the United States of America and then proceeds to speak with slang and improper grammar. In the United States, as we highly respect a man of this caliber, we expect him to fully express how educated he is and sound like he knows what he’s talking about. The president will most surely believe said individual to be an incompetent fool. The president will feel that he is personally being mocked by having to speak to this particular individual. Now take that scene again, but this time, have said individual speak very respectfully and intellectually. Now the tables have turned, haven’t they? The president will regard this individual as a wise person and will more likely actually listen to what this person has to say. This is why it’s imperative for interviewers to act very educated and come appropriately dressed for the occasion. They must be aware of the consequences of speaking with informal language. Knowing how to speak formally is important; however, one should also be able to speak informally as needed.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Although it is important to know how to speak formally, one may argue that always speaking formally can make one seem pompous or bombastic. Because of this very reason, it is very important that one maintains a certain level of restriction for formality. In a more relaxed scenario, one must respect the calm and casual environment and not attempt to make the environment tense. Even if one knows how to speak formally very well, he should only use it when it is necessary and he should not attempt to make a fool of himself by speaking formally in a casual scenario. For example, if one is conducting a discussion amongst friends, then he has no need to speak formally. When ones goes to speak with his boss, however, he must quickly change his attitude and tone to make sure he doesn’t get fired on the spot. It will be very obvious when one is trying to change the stress level of a situation based on their tone. Managing tone is an important aspect in language. Even if one has perfect grammar and educated word choice, one mustn’t sound uneasy or unclear. This can indicate an individual who is weak or is not very well-versed in persuasive speech. This could also perhaps be perceived as trying too hard to impress someone.

                                James Baldwin once claimed that language is, “the key to identity and social acceptance.” He is trying to say that people must respect their use of language and alter it as necessary to fit the current situation. This is most definitely the case. One most surely does not want to be misjudged into the wrong identity, especially if the event is important or momentous. If one is misjudged, it may lead to catastrophic and devastating outcomes that are undesirable. It is possible that one may be thought of as something that they most definitely are not trying to seem as. One may be thought of as a fool, incompetent, or highly uneducated. It is a very important skill indeed for one to be able to identify when one is to act a certain way including how to alter his speech for the occasion. Good language skills can be the final determiner on occasions such as job interviews or sales pitches. It can also be important when trying to convince one’s audience about some point or perspective. If someone seems to be either more or less educated than they are expected to be in a certain situation, they may not be accepted into society and people may even feel offended by their use of speech.

                            <p>In this essay, the biggest issue I found was that I used the word "one" with singular pronouns such as "he" too much. I replaced some of these occurrences with "his or her." Other times, I removed these incorrect pronouns and rewrote the sentences in order to avoid the use of pronouns entirely. These changes added a bit of variety to my sentences.</p>
