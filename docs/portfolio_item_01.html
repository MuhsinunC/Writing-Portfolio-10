                                Being funny can be hard! In order to know what is amusing, one must know what is not. One must know what is still considered new and rich. Not all new ideas will be accepted as humorous, thus, one must figure out which ones are. Being funny takes hard work, determination, and skill. One must be committed and witty. To certain people, being comical comes naturally, but for others, it takes work. Mark Twain once said, “Show me a man who knows what’s funny, and I’ll show you a man who knows what’s not.” This shows that it is important to know both sides of the story when dealing with humor. Being funny is an art, and it takes work to improve. One can better understand humor by looking at different perspectives.

                                Some may argue that entertaining someone is easy; however, that is hardly the truth, as being funny takes skill. Being funny takes hard work and determination. Being quick on one’s feet as well as being well versed without sounding rehearsed are required abilities. The quote says that one must know what is funny and what is not. Knowing such is important as one may accidentally make a cruel or hurtful joke about another. One must always know the limits of joking. Subjects such as calamities or disasters should not be joked about as they can trigger emotions evoking pain. Although one has freedom of speech, people also have freedom of expression and can easily get mad at someone for an offensive joke. One must know the consequences of joking about sensitive topics. In the past, I have heard my friends tell racially insensitive jokes. Although some may find these funny, others may take offense. One must understand the rules and boundaries of being funny.

                                Always know when it is appropriate to say something and when it is not. One must make sure that their audience is not sensitive to the material that they make jokes about. Being funny is an art and it takes practice. Don’t rush it as practice makes perfect. If need be, practice stand-up comedy. One must do their research and be prepared. In spite of the fact that one may know what is humorous in a certain situation, one may not always be equipped for all audiences. Knowing what is not funny at the right time will keep people from getting angry or hurt. As stated earlier, joking about tough subjects may evoke certain emotions such as pain, anger, or sadness from certain audiences. Being funny is an art and it takes skill. One should always look at all perspectives in order to better understand humor.

                            <p>In this essay, I saw a lot of repetition. I worked to cut down on the use of the same words and phrases over and over again. I also made sure to use "his or her" instead of "their" when necessary. Finally, I worked to further develop parallel structure in my piece.</p>

                                Being funny isn’t exactly the easiest skill to master. In order to know what is amusing, one must first acknowledge what is not.
