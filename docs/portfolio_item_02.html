                                We can learn a lot from our fellow insect friends and that’s why we have to protect them. The TED talk presented by Deborah Gordon speaks of how we can learn from our fellow insect friends. She speaks of how, by inspecting how an ant colony behaves, we can learn more about the way that both our brain and cancer work. The one thing that all three of these topics have in common is that they don’t have any central authority. They just do what they need to do and get it done. Although there is a queen ant in an ant colony, she doesn’t actually wield power over any other ants. Ants all have the goal of finding resources and expanding their empire, similar to how cancer works. They also have a complex web of interconnected communications and information routes, similar to how our brains function. Deborah Gordon believes that we can gain insight about cancer and our brain by investigating further and delving deeper into the lives of ants. I agree with Deborah. The information gathered from something like this may be immensely useful for the studies to battle cancer. She explained how we could theoretically find out how cancer cells “communicate” and set traps to catch them before they grow too large or metastasis. If we could also better understand how ants communicate, we might be able to understand how to read our memories from our brain and it could be just like reading data off of a hard drive.

                                The TED talk given by E.O. Wilson on his wish to create an encyclopedia of life talks about how we need to stay informed about the organisms on our planet. We only know about a handful of organisms that live on Earth in the grand scope of things. In order to continue exploring our environment and continue discovering new species, we must first make sure our ecosystem doesn’t get destroyed. At our current rate, we are destroying our environment irreparably. E.O. Wilson wants us to create an encyclopedia that encompassas all knowledge of all living organisms and species. He wants to be able to, in a sense, preserve all the species that live on Earth. I agree with E.O. Wilson’s wishes. It is a very good idea to keep everything documented as this will be a safeguard in case we do end up destroying our environment. If it really is true that we know hardly any of the living species on this glorious planet of ours, then it would be in our best interest to keep our environment and ecosystem safe in order for us to continue discovering these magnificent creatures. E.O. Wilson speaks of the recent discoveries of new whales, and micro-organisms. There is just so much more out there that we still need to discover. E.O. Wilson elaborates that there is already a website that crowdsources its information on the biodiversity of the Earth. He explains that he wants us to add to it more. I agree with this request. If we all add what we know, then our combined knowledge may find new breakthroughs. We need to protect this beautiful planet of ours.

                            <p>A lot of what I had originally wrote in this essay was really messy. Interest was shown in ideas that weren't fully fleshed out. Unfortunately, when I had originally written this essay, I assumed that my reader already understood what I was talking about. This is not a good habit to get into. It's always good to write under the impression that your reader is clueless about the topic that you are writing about, so you should be very specific when fleshing out ideas.</p>

                                Our fellow insectoid friends know a lot more about the environment than we credit them for. The TED talk presented by Deborah Gordon speaks of how we can learn from our fellow insect friends. She speaks of how, by inspecting how an ant colony behaves, we can learn more about the way that both our brain and cancer work. The one thing that all three of these topics have in common is that they don’t have any central authority. They just do what they need to do and get it done. Although there is a queen ant in an ant colony, she doesn’t actually wield power over any other ants. Ants all have the goal of finding resources and expanding their empire, similar to how cancer works. They also have a complex web of interconnected communications and information routes, similar to how our brains function. Deborah Gordon believes that we can gain insight about cancer and our brain by investigating further and delving deeper into the lives of ants. Deborah believes that if we compare cancerous tumors with ant colonies, we may find some connections, especially in terms of not having any central authority. Deborah’s theory strikes a feeling of agreement within me. The information gathered from something like this may be immensely useful for the studies to battle cancer. Her evidence is greatly revealing and shows us what’s been hiding right under our noses this whole time. She explained how we could theoretically find out how cancer cells “communicate” and set traps to catch them before they grow too large or metastasis. This is similar to the way that ants communicate directly with each other rather than reporting to a central authority. If we could also better understand how ants communicate, we might be able to understand how to read our memories from our brain and it could be just like reading data off of a hard drive. If we can figure out this system, we could theoretically back up our minds. This works because of the way that neurons in our brains communicate with each other.

                                The TED talk given by E.O. Wilson on his wish to create an encyclopedia of life talks about how we need to stay informed about the organisms on our planet. We only know about a handful of organisms that live on Earth in the grand scope of things. There are so many more creatures that we don’t even know the existence of. There are literally billions of bacteria living on you right now! In order to continue exploring our environment and continue discovering new species, we must first make sure our ecosystem doesn’t get destroyed. At our current rate, we are destroying our environment irreparably. If we destroy the environments of organisms we haven’t even discovered yet, then we will forever make it impossible to ever discover these creatures. E.O. Wilson wants us to create an encyclopedia that encompassas all knowledge of all living organisms and species. He wants to be able to, in a sense, preserve all the species that live on Earth. I agree with E.O. Wilson’s wishes to create this encyclopedia. It is a very good idea to keep everything documented as this will be a safeguard in case we do end up destroying our environment.

If we all add what we know, then our combined knowledge may find new breakthroughs. We need to protect this beautiful planet of ours. After all, we only have this one single planet that was given to us free of charge.
