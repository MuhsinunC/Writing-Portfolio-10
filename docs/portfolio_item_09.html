                                When I used to boss my staff around, I used to be a strict boss. I used to give them really hard tasks and I didn’t pay them enough. They used to get mad at me for expecting so much from them. But, they had respect for me. They were astonished that I could even hold them together and that I knew what to do and when, given my age at the time. You don’t have to be old to be respectable, you just need to have some good and worthy quality that others can appreciate and respect. At first, they were skeptical of my leadership, but over time, they saw that I could get work done at the end of the day. Respect is something that one must earn. Although people will tell you to respect your elders, just because someone is older than you doesn’t mean they deserve respect. That saying applies more often to wise elders. Someone can be young but they might still deserve respect. Respect can be earned from good leadership of it could even be earned from simply being a nice person. Mistakes can be tolerated although too many can reduce one’s level of respect. Sometimes, however, respect can be inherited by, say being the son of an influential politician. In spite of the fact that some people are the offspring of bad people, they may still be respected and they can earn more respect. Respect isn’t easy to earn. It takes care and determination.

                            <p>Although I had originally turned in this essay's first draft as my final draft, it was definitely written like a first draft. First and foremost, I wrote the entire essay in a single block, an issue that I commonly face in my rough/first drafts. When I write essays for the first time, I'm in such a rush to put down all my thoughts onto paper that I forget to make sure that my ideas flow into well-organized paragraphs, so when I go to revise these rough/first drafts, I almost always have to reorganize everything, and that's exactly what I had to do here. I also fixed some grammatical mistakes and fleshed out some ideas some more. Furthermore, I made my anecdote a bit more clear and easier to follow.</p>

You don’t have to be old to be respectable, you just need to have some good and worthy quality that others can appreciate and respect. At first, they were skeptical of my leadership, but over time, they saw that I could get work done at the end of the day. I’m not saying that I was right in underpaying them or being strict. I’m saying that it’s important to do respectable things if we want to earn respect.

                                Respect is something that one must earn. Although people will tell you to respect your elders, just because someone is older than you doesn’t mean they deserve respect. That saying applies more often to wise elders. Someone can be young but they might still deserve respect. Respect can be earned from good leadership or it can even be earned by simply being a nice person. Although mistakes can be tolerated, too many of them can reduce one’s level of respect. Sometimes, however, respect can be inherited by, say being the son of an influential politician. In spite of the fact that some people are the offspring of bad people, they may still be respected and they can earn more respect. Respect can also come from status. Say someone did something honorable or brave. This can result in an increase in respect. If a leader wants to be respectable, he or she must show that they deserve respect by being both caring and responsible. Respect isn’t easy to earn. It takes hard work and determination.

                                Love is a complicated matter. It’s not as simple as either loving or hating someone. There’s a middle ground as well as a scale between the two. There are also different forms of love. For example, there is the first one that pops into your head when you first hear the word “love.” That one is when you find someone worthy of living your life with as a marital partner. Another form is the love that best friends have. You might still be willing to spend your life with them, but not necessarily as marital partners. The final one is tough love. This is the one that you show to someone who you want to succeed at something. This is most commonly shown from parent to child and trainer to trainee.

                                Although many people experience the potential/current marital partner form of love, most people experience the best friend form of love. This is the form that is most prevalent in everyday life. In the best friend form of love, one is willing to protect their best friends. This can be in the form of protecting one’s best friends from insults or from harm’s way; however, best friends also joke around and insult each other commonly on a daily basis. The form that I am most familiar with in my everyday life is best friend love.

                            <p>This essay felt incomplete. Most likely, I wrote this essay right near the end of class and ran out of time so I had to wrap things up a bit early. When I went back to revise this essay, I made sure to give a better ending to this essay. I added some better anecdotes to appeal to the reader's pathos and also tied up some loose ends at the end of my first paragraph.</p>

The form that I am most familiar with in my everyday life is best friend love. Personally, when I am with my best friends, I tend to repeatedly insult them in the name of fun. Not everyone is like this however, as some people might be more sensitive than others. The key to finding this type of love is finding the best kind of friend that clicks with your personality the best. My friends and I share similar tastes in humor, therefore we are able to easily create moments that we find hilarious. Although we like our humor, other people may find our humor rude or annoying.
