                                Alice Walker, in the fictional piece, “Everyday Use,” intends to shed light on the misinterpretation of culture. Specifically, Walker gives an example of Dee’s family, a Black family living in Southern America in the late 1960s. Dee grows up embarrassed of her family culture; however, when she grows up, she ends up coming back home to take with her artifacts that she feels represent her heritage. The issue with her actions and desires for her family heirlooms is that her understanding of her heritage is incorrect. One mustn’t be ignorant of his or her culture and heritage in order to fully understand and embrace it.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                The reason that the title, “Everyday Use,” is significant is because Dee feels that her family’s usage of everyday objects is morally wrong. The society that she grew up a part of taught her that these everyday objects are to be cherished and appreciated whereas her mother and sister, Maggie, see them as regular objects that are meant to be used, “Maggie can’t appreciate these quilts!... She’s probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.” (Walker, 54) Evidently, Dee feels that these items have much more value than her mother and sister believe they have. Dee also feels that she understands her heritage more than her mother does, “‘What don’t I understand?’ I [Mama] wanted to know. ‘Your heritage,’ she [Dee] said.” (55) Even though Dee’s mother actually knows a lot more about their heritage than Dee does, Dee continues to fall victim to the continued misunderstanding of her culture.

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Another example of Dee misinterpreting her culture would be her new name, “No, Mama… not ‘Dee,’ Wangero Lee wanika kemanjo!” (51) Not only does Dee mix up names from different cultures, but she also butchers the spelling. Dee misspells her name, “Wangero is not a kikuyu name, but Wanjiru is. It is one of the other original nine clan names of the kikuyus.” (Hoel, 3) Dee changing her name also causes a disrespect to her true heritage. Dee was a name that goes back through her ancestry, “‘You know as well as me you was named after your aunt Dicie’... in fact, I probably could have carried it back beyond the Civil War through the branches.” (51-52) Dee’s decision to change her name to that of a completely different culture was very disrespectful to her ancestral line.

                            <br>

                                One can never truly understand and embrace his or her culture and heritage if he or she is ignorant of it. If one desires to properly respect his or her culture, he or she must first become knowledgeable about it. In “Everyday Use,” Dee was misinformed about her heritage. Today, we see so many examples of people who incorrectly make assumptions about their heritage. These people must first acknowledge what they already know about their culture. Only then will they be able to truly embrace and understand it.

She’s probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.” (Walker, 54) Evidently, Dee feels that these items have much more value than her mother and sister believe they have. The irony with this quote is that Dee considers Maggie’s normal use of these quilts to be “backward,” but her desire to hang them on the wall is, in her mind, “normal.” Dee also feels that she understands her heritage more than her mother does, “‘What don’t I understand?’ I [Mama] wanted to know. ‘Your heritage,’ she [Dee] said.” (55) Even though Dee’s mother actually knows a lot more about their heritage than Dee does, Dee continues to fall victim to the continued misunderstanding of her culture.

If one desires to properly respect his or her culture, he or she must first become knowledgeable about it. In “Everyday Use,” Dee was misinformed about her heritage. She was supposed to properly research about her culture on her own. Today, we see so many examples of people who incorrectly make assumptions about their heritage. People are always complaining about how they were/are oppressed when in reality they’re literally not even referencing the culture and heritage that they come from. These people must first acknowledge what they already know about their culture. Only then will they be able to truly embrace and understand it.
