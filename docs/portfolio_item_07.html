                                When was the last time you sacrificed your daily routine and restrictions for your own happiness? Think about it for a minute. It was probably either never or a really long time ago. Why is this? Don’t we love to have fun? We only get one chance at this life, so why are we squirreling it away? You don’t get another go at this.We need to think about this more often.

                                We spend our whole lives so entranced by the idea that we need more. We need more money, more cars, and more free time. We focus so much on getting more that we forget that our time is running out so crazy fast. Even though we might realize that we’re moving too fast sometimes, usually it’s too late for us to fix things. We need to spend our time doing things we love. Yes, it’s important to do things to make sure you can support your family as well as yourself, but it’s even more important that you don’t want your life.

                                We need to be more aware of our time here on Earth. Everyday we live in assumption that we’re going to live another day so we put our hopes and dreams for “tomorrow.” We need to look back on our lives and think to ourselves, “Am I really enjoying what I’m doing with my life?” We become too wrapped up in our everyday lives to see that we’re wasting our lives. We need to be more proactive with what we do with our lives.

                            <p>This essay seemed a bit bare-bones, so I added more to it. I added more to the call-to-action section because that was the most important area. People really need to stop wasting their lives, so I have to convince them with that paragraph. Also, I revised a few sentences that didn't sound as professional as I had wanted them to.</p>
