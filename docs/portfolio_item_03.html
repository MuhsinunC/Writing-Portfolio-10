                                The world. Such a big thing… so delicate… so peaceful. And then there’s us. We zoom in and we destroy everything the world has so gently and carefully crafted. The world. It has so much power, and yet we can destroy it for our own fruits. The world. How often do we actually stop and think about it? What if the world itself has a soul? Do we ever think of that? No. The Alchemist is a book that gives the environment, legends, myths, and of course, alchemy, a whole new level of respect. We may have heard of some of these legends, myths, or proverbs and thought about them ourselves; however, we never experience them as if they’re stories of factual base. The Alchemist gives life to these tales. With amazing imagery and fantastic word choice, this book made me feel like I was in some sort of fantasy world. The Alchemist inspires one to truly question life for what it is. Even though we may believe that we understand the world that we live in, The Alchemist gives it a twist and makes us ask deep questions about our own reality.

                                The theme of The Alchemist is that we should always try; even if we fail, we know that we tried, and that allows us to live guilt-free. The Alchemist is about a boy, named Santiago, who follows his omens to accomplish his dreams (literally). In the beginning of the story, Santiago begins as a shepherd and has a recurring dream of finding treasure near the pyramids of Egypt. Because it was recurring, Santiago decided to go to a palm reader to get it checked out. The old lady told him to go look for it and return with 1/10th of it for her. Later on, an old man who claims to be the king of Salem guides Santiago in exchange for 1/10th of his flock of sheep. Santiago agrees and so begins his journey to find his treasure. Along the way, Santiago meets many people who teach him life lessons and guide him on his journey. Eventually, he comes across an Englishman who is also trying to reach his Personal Legend, or his destiny. The Englishman’s goal is to find the fabled alchemist who can turn mere lead into pure gold. Santiago decides to help the Englishman as he was also headed to Egypt. Santiago and the Englishman end up finding the alchemist, who ends up helping Santiago find his treasure. In the end; however, there is an ironic twist, which leaves the reader joyous.

                                This book really resonated with me because it made me really think about life and question reality. The theme is for one to always try his best, and even if one fails, at least one knows he made an attempt to reach his goal. In the society that we live in today, people’s attention spans are extremely short and tend to give up easily. The Alchemist strives to make us see the bigger picture and attempt to mend our ways in favor of a healthier lifestyle.

                            <p>When I wrote my first draft, I had numerous incomplete clauses. These were clear mistakes and I had to mend them in my revised second draft. Another issue I faced was that I had been trying too hard to be inspirational and deep. I made myself sound less cheesy in my second draft. Also, my reflection paragraph seemed a bit lacking, so I filled it up a bit more with some thought-provoking quotes.</p>

                                The world is such a big thing… so delicate… so peaceful. And then there’s us. We zoom in and we destroy everything the world has so gently and carefully crafted. The world has spent billions of years creating the serene nature that we take for granted. It has so much power, and yet we can destroy it for our own fruits. The world that we live in, how often to we question its formation and the work it has gone through in order to create the beauty that we see? How often do we actually stop and think about it? What if the world itself has a soul? Do we ever think of that? No. The Alchemist is a book that gives the environment, legends, myths, and of course, alchemy, a whole new level of respect.

The theme is for one to always try his best, and even if one fails, at least one knows he made an attempt to reach his goal. There is a famous saying that you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, so take all the opportunities that you get with open arms. It’s much better to take risks now than end up with regrets in the future. In the society that we live in today, people’s attention spans are extremely short and tend to give up easily. The Alchemist strives to make us see the bigger picture and attempt to mend our ways in favor of a healthier lifestyle.
