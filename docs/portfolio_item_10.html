                                In my sophomore year of high school, I learned everything from dependent clauses to 1 compound, 1 complex, 1 compound-complex sentences (if you know you know). But out of all the things I learned, if I had to choose 2 things that I was really grateful to have learned, they would be the ability to write an essay in 10 minutes (because obviously that’s enough time) and the vocabulary packets.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Although we all utterly despised having to write those essays in those extremely small time frames, I think we all have to agree that they were worth it. They prepared us for the rigor that awaits us in the higher tier AP and IB classes that we should [hopefully] be getting into next year. If I didn't have Mrs. Williams as my teacher this year, I don’t think any other teacher would have properly prepared us, as students, for the rigor that we are bound to face next year. I am very grateful for the opportunity that I took advantage of this year by being in Mrs. Williams’s English class.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                The reason that I really liked the vocabulary packets was because I personally love to learn new words and phrases. I don’t believe that I have as large a vocabulary as I’d like to and these vocabulary packets allowed me to properly exercise my learning skills as I learned new and exhilarating words. The method that Mrs. Williams used to teach us this new vocab was very useful. The use of Vocabulary.com combined with all those sentences and definitions really helped me grasp the words.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                All in all, this year was a great year and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have attended Mrs. Williams’s 10th grade English class. I am looking forward to spending another year with her in AP next year as I am excited to continue to learn and exercise my writing skills. Something that I believe I need to do more of on my own, however, is using the new words I’ve learned in my everyday language so then I can easily implement them in my essays. I need to up my game if I want to get into these top colleges. I’m hoping you can help me with that as we finish this year and meet again next year Mrs. Williams. Thank you for the amazing experience that was your messy, random, and quite frankly hilarious class.
