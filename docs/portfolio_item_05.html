                                The Mechanical Hound paused for a brief moment. It was near Faber’s house. It sniffed around and circled the house a couple of times. Soon enough, however, it continued on its journey to search for Montag’s genetic sequence. Montag let out a sigh of relief, “Thank goodness Faber is alright. I would hate to have had brought him into this ordeal.” Granger said, “Montag, we need to do something. I’ve seen this before. The government will target and kill someone else.” After a long pause, Montag finally replied, “Alright, I’m going back. The city needs me. I can’t let all these people live in ignorance. We need to educate them. This government is corrupt and must be overthrown.” “It’s too dangerous right now,” Granger exclaimed, “They are not ready for us. Not yet.” “But we have to do something,” Montag argued, “I’m going. I have to.” “Be safe,” Granger reluctantly replied.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Montag had just entered the outskirts of the city when he heard the helicopter zoom past him in the sky. They had found him already. The Mechanical Hound was definitely on its way. This was the end. He didn’t even get a change. “What kind of government is this,” Montag thought to himself. Surely enough, after a minute or so had passed, he heard a movement by him.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                “Auughhhhh… where am I,” Montag groaned as he awoke from his slumber. He looked around. It seemed he was in a holding cell of some sorts, similar to the ones they put people they arrested in. “Hello?” A speaker came on, “You have 5 minutes to explain why you attempted to smuggle books. Your response will be recorded.” The speaker clicked off and a red light turned on. Montag assumed his time had begun and began to speak, “These people need to be educated. We can’t go on like this. You brainwash people into thinking that they live in a utopia, when in fact they’re living in the worst dystopia imaginable! These people know nothing more than what they see on the tele! You monsters censor everything. Books are magical. They allow people to explore their imagination and to explore ways they can better the horrific society they live in. Why do you think so many people continue to read books even though they clearly know that it is illegal to do so? And what you call being ‘social’ is merely conforming to your rules and standards! I demand the freedom of information, knowledge, and speech! Let me out!” The red light turned off. The speaker clicked to life, “We, the Officials, have heard your arguments. They are against the law. The freedom of information was outlawed years ago due to people knowing too much and releasing sensitive government information. We figured out that for true equality, people must not be allowed to discuss or argue about political issues. These issues and arguments were found to stem from books. Books, the evil misinformers. They make people discontent. They make people believe that there is something better than what they currently have. This is wrong. It causes tension. When different people read different books and form different opinions, they become fueled in their perspective and refuse to accept any that differ from their own. Because of this, we created uniformity. This uniformity allowed a nationwide peace. The only danger to this peace was books, so they had to be eliminated. Goodbye.” The speaker clicked off. Montag struggled in his cell as he saw a green gas fill it. This was the end. The world would never change. “I should’ve listened to Granger. They’re not ready for us. No, they’re not ready.” Montag thought to himself as his mind went dark.

                            <p>Some areas in my alternate ending were left cloudy. Certain areas needed further clarification as they were unclear.

                                The Mechanical Hound paused for a brief moment. It was near Faber’s house. It sniffed around and circled the house a couple of times. Although caught for a brief moment, it eventually gave up and failed to find the genetic sequence of Montag. It continued on its journey to search for Montag’s genetic sequence. Montag let out a sigh of relief, “Thank goodness Faber is alright. I would hate to have had brought him into this ordeal.” Granger said, “Montag, we need to do something. I’ve seen this before. The government will target and kill someone else. Someone who is innocent. We need to do something.” After a long pause, Montag finally replied, “Alright, I’m going back. The city needs me. I can’t let all these people live in ignorance. We need to educate them. This government is corrupt and must be overthrown.” “It’s too dangerous right now,” Granger exclaimed, “They are not ready for us. Not yet.” “But we have to do something,” Montag argued, “I’m going.

                                Montag had just entered the outskirts of the city when he heard the helicopter zoom past him in the sky. He looked up in paralyzed fear. They had found him already. The Mechanical Hound was definitely on its way. This was the end. He didn’t even get a chance. “What kind of government is this,” Montag thought to himself. Surely enough, after a minute or so had passed, he heard a movement by him. He quickly turned to see the glowing red eyes of the Mechanical Hound looking right back at him, “Poor thing doesn’t even have a mind of its own.” He slowly began to back away from the Mechanical Hound, raising his hands above his head, but it was no use; the Mechanical Hound struck him with its numbing stinger already. The world around him started to blur as he spiraled and fell to the ground like a heavy sack of potatoes.

Your response will be recorded.” The speaker clicked off and a red light turned on. Montag assumed his time had begun and began to speak, “These people need to be educated. We can’t go on like this. Your stupid rules restrict personal freedom and keep people ignorant. You brainwash people into thinking that they live in a utopia, when in fact they’re living in the worst dystopia imaginable! These people know nothing more than what they see on the tele! You monsters censor everything. Books are magical. They allow people to explore their imagination and to explore ways they can better the horrific society they live in. Why do you think so many people continue to read books even though they clearly know that it is illegal to do so? It’s because they’re amazing. They open a window of opportunity. And what you call being ‘social’ is merely conforming to your rules and standards! I demand the freedom of information, knowledge, and speech! Let me out!” The red light turned off. The speaker clicked to life, “We, the Officials, have heard your arguments. Your goals are against the law. The freedom of information was outlawed years ago due to people knowing too much for their own good and releasing sensitive government information. The freedom of speech was also outlawed years ago due to the tensions caused by differing ideas and opinions. We figured out that for true equality, people must not be allowed to discuss or argue about political issues. When people don’t get the chance to voice their opinions, wars are prevented and arguments ended. These issues and arguments were found to stem from books. Books, the evil misinformers. They make people discontent. They make people believe that there is something better than what they currently have. This is wrong. It causes tension. When different people read different books and form different opinions, they become fueled in their perspective and refuse to accept any that differ from their own. Because of this, we created uniformity. This uniformity allowed a nationwide peace. The only danger to this peace was books, so they had to be eliminated. Your arguments are invalid and as such we have decided to euthanize you. Goodbye.” The speaker clicked off. Montag struggled in his cell as he saw a green gas fill it. This was the end. The world would never change. “I should’ve listened to Granger. They’re not ready for us. No, they’re not ready.” Montag thought to himself as his mind went dark.
