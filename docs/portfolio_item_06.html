                                A muse is someone who influences the protagonist to accomplish a goal. An example would be Meg being Hercules’s muse in the movie Hercules. In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury uses the muse archetype, being Clarisse; this is evident because she causes Montag to open up and finally begin questioning the world around him. Clarisse’s presence enlightened Montag by causing him to being the question society. Because of Clarisse, Montag was able to channel his curiosity into a fueled rebellion against society. Even though Montag was already really curious, Clarisse was the final tipping point for Montag’s deepest desires.

                                In Fahrenheit 451’s dystopian society, Clarisse is seen as an outcast because she’s different from everyone else. Her uniqueness is seen as dangerous by the government. Clarisse says, “Being with people is nice. But I don’t think it’s social to get a bunch of people together and not let them talk, do you?” (Bradbury, 14) This quote shows how she questions the things in society that no one else does. Clarisse’s deep thinking and questioning of how the world works is exactly why Montag was so interested in her. Clarisse also says, “Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.” (4) Clarisse later asks Montag whether he took a look at the billboards and he says yes. She seemed so innocent, so pure. Her attitude was contagious and Montag had caught it. He was entranced by her inner beauty and always listened to what she had to say. Her curiosity and innocent death was the final tipping point which had forced Montag to unleash his deepest desires to read books; as a result, he was unstoppable. Although she wasn’t trying, she became Montag’s muse; consequently, Montag used her for motivation.

                                Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 uses Clarisse as Montag’s muse to make Montag more open-minded. A muse is a common archetype used to motivate the protagonist. Muses ensure that the protagonist is motivated to reach his or her goal. In real life, muses can also encourage people to accomplish their dreams or improve on their shortcomings. In our society, we have really short attention spans and don’t have much patience. If we all had someone to motivate us we’d all work harder toward our goals. We all need something or someone to motivate us.

The government doesn’t like people who think like her because they’re the ones who question society and are able to identify what’s wrong with it. In our current society, people rarely question society. They just accept things as they are and don’t try to delve deeper into things. This type of mindset is dangerous because it can lead to a dystopian society such as the one that Fahrenheit 451 takes place in. Clarisse’s deep thinking and questioning of how the world works is exactly why Montag was so interested in her. Clarisse also says, “Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long?

                                Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 uses Clarisse as Montag’s muse to make Montag more open-minded. A muse is a common archetype used to motivate the protagonist. They ensure that the protagonist has a goal that they are working towards so they aren’t making attempts in vain. Muses ensure that the protagonist is motivated to reach his or her goal. In real life, muses can also encourage people to accomplish their dreams or improve on their shortcomings. Muses aren’t always attainable, just as Clarisse was unattainable. In our society, we have really short attention spans and don’t have much patience. If we all had someone to motivate us we’d all work harder toward our goals. We all need something or someone to motivate us.

                                In the movie version of Fahrenheit 451, Francois Truffaut uses the banning of books to reinforce the theme of censorship present in both the book and the movie. Books express the freedoms of the press, expression, and speech. Banning books essentially means banning freedom. The government claims that banning books keeps people from becoming discontent with their society; however, this is all just a ruse. The government in Fahrenheit 451 just wants to brainwash its citizens into thinking they live in a utopian society and that their all-powerful government is perfect. The government inverted the job of firefighters from putting out/fighting fires to actually starting them instead. While the government claims that burning books is merely a way to keep people content with their own lives, the burning of books actually symbolizes the censorship of history; similarly, our real-life government censors information and data from reaching us as well. This violates the Constitution, but nobody knows because they never got the chance to read it.

                                More than ever before, this theme applies to our current society. We’re finding out so often that the government is censoring information from the public. Merely a very small percentage of sensitive and censored governmental data is actually successfully leaked. Even though a very marginal amount of data has been leaked, we’ve learned immeasurable things from these leaks. Imagine how much information there is that the government knows that we don’t know… The Media controls the flow of all information. The overwhelming majority of people obtain their information from news sources and other outlets of the sort, which are all controlled and maintained by the Media. I know of many cases in which the Media was bribed to not spread and broadcast important events.

The issues that we see the in the society in Fahrenheit 451 are issues that are beginning to come up in our current society. We need to look at ourselves before this gets out of hand. Therefore, I have made a more of a call-to-action at the end of this revision.</p>

The government in Fahrenheit 451 just wants to brainwash its citizens into thinking they live in a utopian society and that their all-powerful government is perfect. No government can ever be perfect. The government in Fahrenheit 451 knows this so instead of actually improving itself, it just decided to make the masses more ignorant instead.

                                Does society and the world around one change his or her perspectives or beliefs? In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury uses societal influences on characters to reinforce the idea that societal norms and influences force an individual to change his or her behavior or perspective. The society in Fahrenheit 451 causes some characters to transition from static to dynamic characters while others don’t. A static character is anyone who doesn’t change as the story proceeds. These would be all the firefighters, except Montag and Beatty, and most of the city’s inhabitants. A dynamic character is one who changes as the story progresses. Montag was a dynamic character as he changed his perspective from a more ignorant one to a more open-minded one. Not all characters in Fahrenheit 451 were static or dynamic. While it was easy to tell whether some characters were static or dynamic, others were harder to tell; specifically, Mildred was a confusing one.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Near the start of the book, Mildred only cared about everything that society wanted her to care about. She said, “How long do you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall-TV put in? It’s only two thousand dollars.” (Bradbury, 9) At first, she depended on Montag for everything. She depended on him for empty love and affection as well as money. She used Montag to her advantage. Although she needed and depended on him at first, she became independent toward the end of the book. The author wrote, “She ran past with her body stiff, her face floured with powder, her mouth gone, without lipstick. ‘Mildred, you didn’t put in the alarm!’” (53) This quote shows how Mildred didn’t care for Montag anymore and so she felt no dependence on him anymore. Although Mildred didn’t become open-minded, Montag, with the help of Clarisse, did. Clarisse was a static character. She started out open-minded and didn’t change from her philosophical mindset. The book implies that Beatty was just like Montag at one point. He speaks of lines and phrases from the many books he read in the past. After Beatty’s discovery and exploration of books, he concluded that books were nonsense; in contrast, the reading of books influenced Montag drastically. Montag believed in the amazing properties and qualities of books. At first, Faber appeared to be a simple English teacher who was uneducated about books, but at the end his true passion for books shined through.

                                Fahrenheit 451’s oppressive society attempts to force its citizens to conform to society and its standards; however, there are individuals such as Montag, Clarisse, Faber, and Granger who manage to overcome these oppressions. If we as individuals in our own society don’t make an effort to overcome the government’s unjust restrictions, then we will fall behind as a society. If we don’t make an effort as Montag, Clarisse, Faber, and Granger did, our society will not advance. We will fall back due to oppression and idiocy of the masses. We must always remain tolerant and receptive to new perspectives and ideas. Although these books are fictional, they’re realistic fiction. They indeed can happen if we’re not careful. Our society takes freedom as a joke and thus doesn’t see the repercussions that can result from losing it.

                            <p>I'm afraid to admit that this essay did indeed need a bit of work. Originally, I was in a rush when I had written this essay. I was just trying to make sure I answered all the questions that I had to answer. This was a mistake. After I reread this essay, I saw that when I was talking about all the characters and whether there were static or dynamic, I wrote a mere single sentence or two about them. I had to go back and add more to this. This was unacceptable so I added much more about these characters and why there were static or dynamic.</p>

                                Does society and the world around one change his or her perspectives or beliefs? In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury uses societal influences on characters to reinforce the idea that societal norms and influences force an individual to change his or her behavior or perspective. The society in Fahrenheit 451 causes some characters to transition from static to dynamic characters while others remain static. A static character is anyone who doesn’t change as the story proceeds. These would be all the firefighters, except Montag and Beatty, and most of the city’s inhabitants. A dynamic character is one who changes as the story progresses. Montag was a dynamic character as he changed his perspective from a more ignorant one to a more open-minded one. Not all characters in Fahrenheit 451 were static or dynamic. While it was easy to tell whether some characters were static or dynamic, others were harder to tell; specifically, Mildred was a confusing one.

                                Near the start of the book, Mildred only cared about everything that society wanted her to care about. She said, “How long do you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall-TV put in? It’s only two thousand dollars.” (Bradbury, 9) At first, she depended on Montag for everything. She depended on him for empty love and affection as well as money. She used Montag to her advantage. Although she needed and depended on him at first, she became independent toward the end of the book. The author wrote, “She ran past with her body stiff, her face floured with powder, her mouth gone, without lipstick. ‘Mildred, you didn’t put in the alarm!’” (53) This quote shows how Mildred didn’t care for Montag anymore and so she felt no dependence on him anymore. Although Mildred didn’t become open-minded, Montag, with the help of Clarisse, did. Clarisse was a static character. She started out open-minded and didn’t change from her philosophical mindset. All throughout the story, Clarisse questioned society and was very deep-thinking. Everything she said was very thought-provoking. The book implies that Beatty was just like Montag at one point. That being, he was curious and wanted to learn about the fuss about books — just like Montag. He speaks of lines and phrases from the many books he read in the past. After Beatty’s discovery and exploration of books, he concluded that books were nonsense; in contrast, the reading of books influenced Montag drastically. Montag believed in the amazing properties and qualities of books. At first, Faber appeared to be a simple English teacher who was uneducated about books, but at the end his true passion for books shined through. Faber opened up to Montag about his love for books after Montag showed him that he could be trusted with Faber’s secrets.

We should always give all opinions a chance to thrive so that everyone sees them from all perspectives before making a decision on them. Although these books are fictional, they’re realistic fiction. They indeed can happen if we’re not careful. We need to take our right to freedom seriously and not take it for granted. Our society takes freedom as a joke and thus doesn’t see the repercussions that can result from losing it.

                                An overarching theme in “The Cask of Amontillado” by Edgar Allen Poe is that one should be careful of whom he or she puts trust and faith in. Fortunato, one of Montresor’s friends, gravely insults him; subsequently, Montresor decides to kill him. Because of his dire need for vengeance against Fortunato, Montresor ends up luring Fortunato into the catacombs while he’s drunk; after a while, he traps him in a wall to slowly kill him. Fortunato’s mistake of trusting Montresor is evident when the author writes Montresor’s thoughts, “He had a weak point—this Fortunato—although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.” (Poe, 1) Because of Fortunato’s love for wine, Montresor was able to successfully set a trap for Fortunato. In order to lure Fortunato to his death, Montresor told him to come to the catacombs for wine. There he murdered Fortunato. From this scenario we can learn that we should keep our weaknesses private. For if we reveal our weaknesses to the wrong people, we may end up gravely regretting our error. A person should always be aware of what they say and whom they are speaking to or of.

                                The theme of “The Cask of Amontillado” really stood out to me. Time and time again I myself have been personally hurt by someone because I trusted them too much. This is why I have become so distrusting of people now. Trust is and should be something that is hard to earn. Trusting the wrong people can lead to pain and misery. Evaluate your situation as well as the person whom you plan to trust in the future. Always be careful before revealing your weaknesses to anyone. Keep your eyes and ears open. “The Cask of Amontillado” also tells us to be wary of whom we insult. For if we insult the wrong person, we may be sorry.

                            <p>Most of the work that I did on this essay was in the second paragraph. The second paragraph was my personal response to the theme of "The Cask of Amontillado." I made sure to really put some real pathos in my writing with this essay. This theme in particular really made me think about and re-evaluate my decision to be friends with certain people and I made sure to make that evident in my revised essay.</p>

For if we reveal our weaknesses to the wrong people, we may end up gravely regretting our error. This story tells us to keep our circles small, and only keep the people we truly trust within our circles. A person should also always be aware of what they say and whom they are speaking to or of. Saying or doing the wrong thing to the wrong person can be a mistake that we take to our graves.

This is why I have become so distrusting of people now. Although this in itself is not a good habit, it is still a preventative measure against trusting the wrong people. Trust is and should be something that is hard to earn. Never give out your trust like it doesn’t mean anything. Only trust those who have shown that they are worthy of your trust through their actions — not their words. Trusting the wrong people can lead to pain and misery. Evaluate your situation as well as the person whom you plan to trust in the future. Always be careful before revealing your weaknesses to anyone. Keep your eyes and ears open. “The Cask of Amontillado” also tells us to be wary of whom we insult. For if we insult the wrong person, we may be sorry.
